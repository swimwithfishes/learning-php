# Homework

 Get PHP 7+, the latest version of PHP installed on your machine using one of the methods:

- **For Mac**:

   Homebrew

- **For Windows**:

    MAMP, WAMP, or XAMPP.

Any of these options will do just fine. To confirm that you've completed the homework, open the command line, and run php -v.

Does it say PHP 7? Congrats!
